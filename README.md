## STOP WATCH

### The technologies I used in creating this application are HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap and JavaScript.

1. I have used basic HTML elements to create the structure of the application.
2. I have used CSS and Bootstrap to design and make the structure effective.
3. Finally JavaScript is used for the functionality.

### How to use the application

1. When the start button is clicked the timer starts and the start button gets disabled, we can also see the text **"RUNNING..."** on the top of the timer.
2. The start button will again gets enabled only after clicking either stop or reset button.
3. If the stop button is clicked, the timer stops and the text **"STOPPED"** will be visible at the top.
4. Finally reset button, we are able to click reset button whenever(when the timer is running/stopped) we want. Clicking reset button will make the time set again to 00:00 and we can see default **"STOP WATCH"** text at the top.
